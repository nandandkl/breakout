# Brick Breaker Game

## 🎮 Overview
This is a simple Brick Breaker game implemented using the `graphics` module in Python. The game features a paddle, a bouncing ball, and multiple bricks that the player must destroy by deflecting the ball with the paddle.

## ✨ Features
- 🎯 **Mouse-controlled Paddle**: The paddle follows the mouse cursor along the x-axis.
- 🧱 **Brick Destruction**: The ball bounces off bricks and removes them upon collision.
- 🏆 **Score Tracking**: The player's score increases as they break bricks.
- ❌ **Game Over Condition**: The game ends when the ball falls below the paddle.
- 🎉 **Win Condition**: The game congratulates the player when all bricks are destroyed.

## 🕹 How to Play
1. ▶️ Run the script to start the game.
2. 🖱 Move the mouse left or right to control the paddle.
3. 🔄 Keep the ball from falling by bouncing it off the paddle.
4. 🧨 Break all the bricks to win the game.

## 🛠 Installation & Requirements
- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 📦 **The `graphics` module** (ensure it is installed or available in the project directory)

## 📌 Code Structure
