# Brick Breaker Game

## 🎮 Overview
This is a simple Brick Breaker game implemented using the `graphics` module in Python. The game features a paddle, a bouncing ball, and multiple bricks that the player must destroy by deflecting the ball with the paddle.

## ✨ Features
- **Mouse-controlled Paddle**: The paddle follows the mouse cursor along the x-axis.
- **Brick Destruction**: The ball bounces off bricks and removes them upon collision.
- **Score Tracking**: The player's score increases as they break bricks.
- **Game Over Condition**: The game ends when the ball falls below the paddle.
- **Win Condition**: The game congratulates the player when all bricks are destroyed.

## 🕹 How to Play
1. Run the script to start the game.
2. Move the mouse left or right to control the paddle.
3. Keep the ball from falling by bouncing it off the paddle.
4. Break all the bricks to win the game.

## 🛠 Installation & Requirements
- **Python 3**
- **The `graphics` module** (ensure it is installed or available in the project directory)

## 📌 Code Structure
- **`main()`**: Initializes the canvas, creates bricks, paddle, and ball, and starts the game loop.
- **`colorpicker()`**: Returns a random color for bricks.
- **`game_loop()`**: Handles ball movement, paddle tracking, collision detection, and game logic.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add multiple difficulty levels.
- Implement power-ups and special bricks.
- Add sound effects and animations.
